#
# HOW TO ADD PROPERTIES:
#     If you want to add new properties, either create your own lang files, or add this property first to the 
#		lang.properties file, which is the reference for all existing properties. 
#		Each property missing in lang.properties, will be removed from all other properties file in the next execution 
#		of build_translation.xml 
#
#
# HOW TO UPDATE TRANSLATIONS:
# All information for contributors is available here:
# 
# http://jupload.sourceforge.net/howto-translation.html
#
#
# QUICK DESCRIPTION:
# Please update the files in the /src/main/lang.utf-16/ directory.
# As the directory is named, they are all in UTF-16 format. Then execute the build_translation.xml file, to 
# report these modifications to the wjhk/jupload/lang pacakge, for use in the applet.
#
# Doing this, allows: 
# - To have all translation in Human readable text, instead of unicode text. 
# - To mark all missing text, in other languages (important note: the lang.properties file is the reference for all properties).
#
#
# The %1$d (and similar) code sequences are placeholders for variable substitution,
# The sequence %% represents a single percent-character.
